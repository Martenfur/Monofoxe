# Monofoxe Template

This template will create a ready to use Monofoxe solution. The solution contains 4 projects:

- Projectname - The main project. All the game logic goes there. You cannot run this project by itself and will need one of the platform projects to run it.
- Projectname.Content - The content of the project. Contans all game assets like graphics, music, fonts, etc.
- Projectname.DX - Windows platform project. Use it to run the game using DirectX.
- Projectname.GL - Windows platform project. Use it to run the game using OpenGL. Note that unlike Monogame, this project only supports Windows by default.
