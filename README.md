Monofoxe is a relatively simple game engine based on [Monogame](http://monogame.net).
It's currently in development and not really recommended for real projects... yet.

Monofoxe took a lot of inspiration from Game Maker, so transitioning from it shouldn't be very painful.

Current features:

* Graphics pipeline and automated batch\vertex buffer management.
* Easy animation from sprite sheets.
* Texture packing.
* Sprite groups and dynamic loading.
* Input tracking.
* Useful math for collisions and game stuff.

Future features:

* FMOD support.
* Hybrid ECS.
* Scene system.
* Linux\Android support.

Not planned:

* 3D.
* iOS\MacOS support.
* Default sound engine wrapper.
* Scripting.

To launch Monofoxe, you'll need:

* [Monogame](http://monogame.net).
* [FMOD API for Windows](http://fmod.com).
