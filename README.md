Monofoxe is a relatively simple game engine based on [Monogame](http://monogame.net).
It's currently in development and not really recommended for real projects... yet.

Monofoxe took a lot of inspiration from Game Maker, so transitioning from it shouldn't be very painful.

Current features:

* Graphics pipeline and automated batch\vertex buffer management.
* Easy animation from sprite sheets.
* Texture packing.
* Sprite groups and dynamic graphics loading.
* Input management.
* Useful math for collisions and othe game stuff.
* Timers, alarms, cameras, state machines, tilemaps, foxes!
* FMOD support (Windows-only for now).
* Hybrid ECS.
* Scene system (with layers!).
* Tiled maps support.

Planned features:

* Animated tiles and inifinite tilemaps from Tiled.
* Particle system.
* Linux\Android support for FMOD.
* Documentation.

Not planned:

* 3D.
* iOS\MacOS support for FMOD.
* Scripting.

To use Monofoxe, you'll need:

* [Monogame](http://monogame.net).
* [Latest release of Monofoxe (VERY outdated)](https://bitbucket.org/gnFur/monofoxe/downloads/MonofoxeDesktopGL.zip).

Just install Monofoxe template, create project with it and you're good to go.
